This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when dealing with recursive functions and array processing. The `processData` function aims to flatten a nested array of strings. However, it has a flaw: it doesn't correctly handle empty strings or non-string elements within the nested arrays.  The solution demonstrates how to properly handle these edge cases using strict type checking and improved logic.
